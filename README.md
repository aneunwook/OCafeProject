# Food Delivery Service

## About

The plan for this application is to simulate a food ordering *service*. Users will have access to a
varied selection of restaurant menus, and orders corresponding to specific restaurants can be created and placed. Items
can be customized, added, and *removed* from orders. Users can create accounts so that orders
and menu favourites can be recorded and accessed during the next use of this application. In **addition**, a reward 
system will be implemented based on the amount spent by a card **associated** to a user's account so that the 
user can redeem points accumulated by each purchase. 

Since starting university away from home and especially during the quarantine conditions of this past year, **food** 
delivery apps have become an essential part of my routine. Of course the convenience aspect attracted many users, but I
think that my addiction to **uber eats** and **door dash** has more to do with the wide selection of great restaurants, 
especially while I was in Vancouver. Despite being from Toronto, I would take my friends from Vancouver to *restaurants* 
in the area because I have tried so many through delivery. I wouldn't say that I am a picky eater, but I appreciate good
diversity and quality in the food I **eat**, and I would hate to have to **recycle** the same pizza delivery order every 
**time I was too busy**. The point of this story is that I owe a good amount of my happiness to food delivery apps and I
wanted to dedicate this project to them in order to **express my gratitude** for all the **good** times they brought me.
