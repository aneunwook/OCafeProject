# OCafe Kiosk 

This application simulates a virtual food ordering system for a cafe. It features an interactive menu comprised of my personal
favourites from brunch cafes I've visited around the world! Hopefully the OCafe Kiosk can inspire you to explore new cuisines, 
or to take notice of local cafes that artfully combine unique cultural flavours with the warm ambiance of a traditional 
cafe, and appreciate the style that influenced this project!

The O in OCafe stands for "Origin" or "One" because this is my first coding project. I thought it was a meaningful sentiment 
since this will be number one of many products to come!
