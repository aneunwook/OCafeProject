# OCafe Kiosk 

This application simulates a virtual food ordering system for a cafe! It features an interactive menu comprised of my personal
favourites from brunch cafes I've visited around the world. Hopefully the OCafe Kiosk can inspire you to explore new cuisines, 
or to take notice of the local cafes which artfully combine unique cultural flavours with the warm ambiance of a traditional 
cafe like the ones that influenced this project! 

The O in OCafe stands for "Origin" or "One" which symbolizes that was my first coding project. I thought this was a 
meaningful sentiment since I intend to create many more!
